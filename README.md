# Weather Trends
### Ryan Sikhrangkur

This project is a report of the weather trends in my local area from the year 1750 until 2013, and was completed for Udacity's data analysis nanodegree program.

For the completion of this report, I retrieved the information from Udacity's online servers using SQL query commands to locate and download the appropriate temperature readings.

Once I downloaded the data into the weather_results.csv file, I read it using Microsoft Excel to calculate and graph the 10-year moving average.

From these calculations and the visualization of the 10-year moving average, I've drawn several observations to include in my report.
